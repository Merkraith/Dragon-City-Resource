                        A collection of information for the mobile game "Dragon City"  I have been playing the game since January of 2018, and I wanted to share information that I have used and shared with friends.  There are alot of resoiurces for the basics of the game and I do not wish to cover that.  But iI was thinking more along to have guides towards making more gold effiently, which helps produce more food effiently too.  Also tips and info with numbers and times to help plan and strategize parts of the game.   All of this is also with the mindset of not having to put $$$ in the game, I achieve lots of good things without having to rely on spending money.
